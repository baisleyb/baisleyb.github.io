          These are my boys. They are thirteen months apart, and they are quite the partners in crime! 
          They know how to manipulate both of us, and they do so effortlessly. They always end up getting
          their way. They also look out for each other, yet will tear each other apart when wanting to 
          play with the same toy. They are fearless. Especially the younger one, nothing deters him. 
          While there are days when they drive me to wits end, there is nothing in this world I love
          more then them.

          This is my amazing wife. I couldn't imagine life without her. She keeps this family running.
          She is the best mom for our kids, always putting their needs first. She is usually the one
          getting up in the middle of the night to tend to them. I, unfortunately, have some sort of
          condition where I don't hear noises at night. Its a curse, really &#128516. She keeps us all 
          fed, which is no easy task, given how picky eaters we are. She comes up with all the cool 
          ideas that keeps life fun. She tolerates my quirks. She encourages me to do great things. 
          She is the one person in the world that I thoroughly love spending every second I can with.
          And she buys me socks and underwear for Christmas, how can anyone top that?

          This is me. Morning coffee maker. Family tech support. Bathroom cleaner. I want to be able to do it all, but I
          know my limits. I can change a flat tire, but that is about all of my automotive abilities. I 
          can replace a light switch or an outlet, but I won't attempt rewiring the house in fear
          it will burn down. And I can bench about 50 pounds. Come on, look at me, I'm not <em>The Rock</em>.

          But I do think I am pretty good at telling computers what to do. Heck, I get paid to do it
          so someone else must agree. My job is improve the stability and reliability of enterprise 
          financial applications. If clients can't trade with us, we lose money. I work to ensure 
          that doesn't happen by finding bugs, automating manual tasks, writing synthetic checks, and
          resolving incidents before they become big problems. And in the little bit of spare time I 
          may get, I like to create websites.
